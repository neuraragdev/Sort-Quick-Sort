# Sort-Quick-Sort

**Quick Sort**
Is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses the concept of Divide and Conquer in order to sort lists.
It is a popular choice for programmers who require quick sorting methods.

**How it Works**
- Choose a pivot element, this is the element that you will be comparing.
- Iterate through the list and compare each element with the pivot.
= Place all the larger elements to the right of the pivot and all the smaller ones to the left.
- Repeat this process with the left and right side separately, now choosing another pivot.
- When singular bocks are reached, they are merged and the array is sorted.
